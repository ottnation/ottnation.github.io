[*OTT Nation*](http:/www.ottnation.com) is dedicated to exploring how ubiquitous connectivity, low cost computing power, and exponential growth in data collection is changing the world we live in -- including the way we interact with others, consume and create content,  and shape and perceive the world around us.

### Why "OTT Nation"?
<div class="box">
    <p>The "OTT" in <em>OTT Nation</em> refers to the "over the top" delivery of data and content via the Internet (be it audiovisual content, sensor data, or personal communications), free from the control or interference of the institutions that provide the communications infrastructure. We like to think of the "Nation" in <em>OTT Nation</em> as referring to a global audience, since we believe that the vast majority of people in the world will be "online" in the not-so-distant future.</p>
